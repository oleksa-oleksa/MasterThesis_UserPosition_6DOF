\chapter{Background}
\label{sec:theorie}
The length and complexity of your theoretical framework depends on your field and topic. Some studies have an obvious basis in a well-established theory, while others require more detailed explanation and justification.



\section{Augmented reality}
\label{sec:theorie:ar}

This chapter introduces the background of the thesis to investigate headmotion prediction. First, the concept of extended reality (XR) related tothe research problem is presented, followed by introducing different headmotion prediction approaches. 

\section{Six degrees of freedom}
\label{sec:theorie:6dof}

This chapter introduces the background of the thesis to investigate head motion prediction. First, the concept of extended reality (XR) related tothe research problem is presented, followed by introducing different headmotion prediction approaches. 

\section{Motion-to-photon latency}
\label{sec:theorie:m2p}

Motion-to-photon latency describes the time gap between a userâ€™s physical motion and the resulting displayed content of an HM. Extended Reality enables 3D content to be experienced with six degrees of free-dom with head-mounted displays (HMD). 

\section{Cloud-based volumetric video streaming}
\label{sec:theorie:cloud}

This chapter introduces the background of the thesis to investigate head motion prediction. First, the concept of extended reality (XR) related tothe research problem is presented, followed by introducing different head motion prediction approaches. 

\section{Head motion prediction}
\label{sec:theorie:head_pred}
In the last decade, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) algorithms have beenadopted for motion prediction of 3D sequences.

\subsection{Challenges}
\label{sec:theorie:head_pred:challenges}
This chapter introduces the background of the thesis to investigate head motion prediction.


\subsection{Deep Learning Algorithms}
\label{sec:theorie:head_pred:deep}
ML refers to a range of techniques that aim to allow sta-tistical models and algorithms to obtain information from given data.
