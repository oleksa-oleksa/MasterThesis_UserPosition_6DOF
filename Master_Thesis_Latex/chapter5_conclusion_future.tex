\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The Python application $UserPrediction6DOF$ is a result of this work and can be used for future preprocessing of the new obtained datasets, training routine and prediction of user position and rotation in 6-DoF virtual environment. 

\section{Analysis}
\label{sec:conclusion:analysis}
Same as in work of \textit{Chang et al., 2020}, the basic GRU performs the best among all models. We surmised that it could be possibly due to the short-term correlation of human actions, so it isn’t often required to consider the longterm complexity. In other words, Bi-LSTM network and TCN which architectures are more complex could be possibly overpredicted instead so that their prediction results aren’t as good as LSTM network in this case.
