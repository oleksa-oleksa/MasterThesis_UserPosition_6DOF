\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
This thesis was created in cooperation with the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute.

I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Daniel Göhring, who consulted me during the work on a thesis, and Prof. Dr. Tim Landgraf, who taught me machine learning so that I chosen my master thesis topic in the field of ML research. 

A special thanks goes to the Serhan Gül, researcher of Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute, who suggested an exciting topic for a research, which I was allowed to choose for my master thesis.
