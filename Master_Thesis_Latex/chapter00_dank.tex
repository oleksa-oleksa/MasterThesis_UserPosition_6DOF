\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
This thesis was created in cooperation with the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute.

I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Daniel Göhring, who consulted me during the work on a thesis, and Prof. Dr. Tim Landgraf, who taught me machine learning so that I chose my master thesis topic in the field of ML research. 

Especially helpful to me during this research was Serhan Gül, researcher of Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute, who suggested an exciting topic for research and supported me. 

I am also grateful to Dr.-Ing. Cornelius Hellge, the head of Multimedia Communications Group at Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute, for allowing me to choose this modern topic for my master thesis. I had great pleasure working with all members of the Multimedia Communications Group  at HHI during the time of research and master thesis creation.
