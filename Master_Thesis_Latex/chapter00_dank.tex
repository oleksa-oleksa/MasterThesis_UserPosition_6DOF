\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
This thesis was created in cooperation with the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute.

I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Daniel Göhring, who consulted me during the work on a thesis. Also I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Tim Landgraf, who made it possible for me to choose a topic in the field of ML as my master thesis topic.

A special thanks goes to the Dr.-Ing. Cornelius Hellge, heading the Multimedia Communications Group at Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute, and Serhan Gül, researcher of Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute, who suggested an exciting topic for a research, which I was allowed to choose for my master thesis.
